## changes in 1.1.0
- changing version tag to reflect peer review status, and creating Zenodo record

## changes in 1.0.3

## changes in 1.0.2
- corrected install script to fix [#14](https://github.com/raspishake/rsudp/issues/14)
- corrected social media URL destination [#15](https://github.com/raspishake/rsudp/issues/15)
- adding feature requested in [#9](https://github.com/raspishake/rsudp/issues/9) (additional text for twitter posts [documented here](https://raspishake.github.io/rsudp/settings.html#tweets-twitter-notification-module))
- edited language as requested in [#13](https://github.com/raspishake/rsudp/issues/13)
- added feature requested in [#17](https://github.com/raspishake/rsudp/issues/17) to control forwarding of `ALARM` and `RESET` messages as well as data

## changes in 0.4.3
